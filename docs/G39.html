<h2 id="cutoff">0.5% cutoff</h2>
<p>We set an initial cutoff of <span class="math inline">\(0.5\%\)</span> to determine the potential genotype priors. For this cutoff we examined the zygousity state, such as homozygousity, heterozygousity and so on.</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">

</div>
<p>With the selected cutoff we saw that there are 5 zygousity states.</p>
